Recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be and as a data analyst, your job is to analyse the data and explore the data.

Most organisations spend money on campaigns and advertisements but in return, they don't get the desired result.
This is because the campaigns and advertisements are not directed to the right group and most campaigns are not 
suited or not brought out during the right period.

Case study questions

* Which products are performing best?

* Which channels are underperforming?

* Which marketing campaign is most successful?

* What does the average customer look like for this company?

* Which countries are the customers from and the country that buys the most??

# Recommendations

- We have more married customers than any other group and as such more campaigns like discounts, after sales service should be directed to them to retain and satisfy them.

- Meat is the highest selling product as such, every campaign used in selling it should be maintained. Campaigns for other products should be improved on.

- To sell more wines, discounts should be given to widows to encourage and retain them.

-  Customers in Mexico, Australia and USA should be encouraged more to use different platforms by using customer awareness services like advertisements.

- More discounts should be directed to the married couple because they used more of it than any other group.

- Campaign two should be dropped or improved on by the marketing team.

-  A lot of complaints came from married couples, singles and divorced, as such, we have to know their pain point as they are very important to the growth of the store.

- The marketing team needs to improve their strategy used in acquiring new customers because the customer counts reduced in Quarter two(Q2) in 2014.
