- To sell more wines, discounts should be given to widows in order to encourage and retain them.

-  Customers in Mexico, Australia and USA should be encouraged more to use different platforms by using customer awareness services like advertisements.

- More discounts should be directed to the married couple because they used more of it than any other group.

- Campaign two should be dropped or improved on by the marketing team.
